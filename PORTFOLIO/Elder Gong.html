<br><br>Elder Gerrit W. Gong of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles spoke during the Saturday evening session of <br> October 2024 general conference. He spoke about living holiness to the Lord every day and shared stories <br>of Church members doing just that. The following is a summary of what he said.
<br><h1>Elder Gong’s talk summary</h1>
<br>“Ours is a gospel of joy and holiness in everyday life.” Holiness invites all to infuse daily living with the sacred.<br>
<br>Church members’ stories of everyday holiness are inspiring. “You live seven C’s: communion with God, <br>community and compassion with each other, commitment and covenant with God, family and friends — <br>centered in Jesus Christ.”<br>
<br>Examples of these stories include a recently married couple “sharing with authenticity and vulnerability <br> gospel covenants, sacrifice and service in their unfolding lives.”

<br>A sister, yearning for a better relationship with her father, felt impressed to take him to the temple with her. <br>This began regular daddy-daughter trips to the temple. “Spending time in the house of the Lord has <br>healed us,” she said.<br>

<br>Jean Gong, Elder Gong’s mother, died earlier this year. The decision to be baptized and join the Church at <br>15 years old is one that most shaped her life. “My mother had covenant faith and trust in the Lord that <br>blessed her life and all our family generations.”<br>

<br>Everyday holiness to the Lord “includes coming more often to the Lord in His holy house.” Doing so <br>“prepares us to live with God our Father, a Man of Holiness, Jesus Christ and our loved ones.”<br>
